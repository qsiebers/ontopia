Ontopoly: The Topic Map Editor
==============================

User's Guide
------------

<p class="introduction">
This is the user guide for Ontopia's self-configuring, ontology-driven Topic Maps editor, Ontopoly.
A topic map consists of both an ontology and an instance of that ontology; with Ontopoly, you can
edit each of these. The ontology defines the rules for what can go into the instance, and these
rules are used by Ontopoly to automatically generate the interface for creating and maintaining the
instance. This document provides guidance for creating both ontologies and
instances.
</p>

<p class="introduction">
Reading this document assumes some basic knowledge about Topic Maps. If you are not familiar with
Topic Maps, try reading one of the simple introductions, such as
<a href="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html">The TAO of Topic Maps</a>, available 
from the Ontopia web site. If you are technically minded, you might also want to look at the 
<a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/">XTM Specification</a> or the new version of ISO 13250, 
especially the <a href="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/">Data Model</a>. We welcome any 
suggestions you might have on ways of improving this User Guide.

<p class="introduction">
We hope you enjoy using Ontopoly!

### Getting started ###

Ontopoly is built as a client/server application. As a client, you use your web browser, while the
server is a web server bundled with the distribution. The server-side application is built using the
Navigator Framework and Web Editor Framework, which are parts of Ontopia. Ontopoly is accessible
within Ontopia, an application that provides easy access to Ontopoly, Omnigator, and
Vizigator.

![Ontopia Home Page](images/doc_home_page.png "Ontopia Home Page")

To install and start up Ontopia, please see `install.html`. Once you have accessed Ontopia, choose
Ontopoly from the available options.

### General concepts ###

#### Application architecture ####

Ontopoly's primary purpose is to enable the manual creation and maintenance of topic maps that may
be based on a variety of ontologies. In order to be able to provide the most intuitive possible user
interface for such a generic application, Ontopoly is *ontology-driven*. What this means is that the
forms-based interface for creating and maintaining a topic map is generated automatically from the
underlying ontology and the rules that are defined for it.

For this reason, you need to create an ontology before you can edit a topic map instance in
Ontopoly. Often the tasks of creating the ontology and editing the topic map instance (that is,
populating the ontology) will be carried out by different people. Ontopoly is therefore divided into
two main parts: the ontology editor and the instance editor. The application also has an
administration interface, i.e., a page for adding metadata to the topic map (description, creator,
version, etc.), validating it, etc.; and an interface for exporting to various interchange
syntaxes.

The Topic Map Index Page allows you to open an existing topic map, create a new one, or import one
from outside Ontopoly. Once you have selected one of these actions, you are taken to the application
pages. The overall architecture and the navigation paths between the various parts of the
application are shown in [Figure: Overview of Ontopoly's
architecture](#overview-of-ontopoly's-architecture).

![Overview of Ontopoly's architecture](images/interface_overview.png "Overview of Ontopoly's architecture")

#### Configuring and populating topic maps ####

Ontopoly's two primary functions provide a comprehensive Topic Maps editing environment.

 1.  **Configuring a topic map**: ontology and schema creation

    Ontopolyâ€™s Type Configuration Pages are used by the ontology designer to define the topic, 
    name, association, association role, and occurrence types that will be available to creators of 
    the instance topics. To take an example, when an author creates a topic of type composer, the 
    Instance Editing Page will show the fields that apply to a composer, such as name, date of birth,
    and works; but when editing an opera, the fields will be different.

    As the ontology designer assigns fields (such as associations and occurrences) to a topic type, 
    the designer is also creating the schema. The creation of the ontology and the schema are 
    seamless and appear to the designer as a cohesive operation. For further detail on ontology 
    creation, see [Using the Type Configuration Pages](#using-the-type-configuration-pages).

 2.  **Populating a topic map**: instance creation
 
    Once an ontology is created, it can be used to guide populating the topic map. The Instance 
    Editing Pages are used by the person authoring the topic map instance. The available topic 
    types are provided from the ontology. The schema constraints give the instance author further 
    support by allowing only specific association types and occurrence types to be used with an 
    instance of a given topic type. For further detail on instance editing, see 
    [Using Instance Editing Pages](#using-instance-editing-pages).

#### User interface conventions ####

Ontopoly has a web-based interface. For a discussion of the various areas of the Ontopoly interface
and a complete list of icons, tabs and buttons used in the interface, please see [Appendix
A](#appA).

#### Topic Map Index Page ####

Before you can create either the ontology or the instance, you have to open a topic map, so let's
start there.

When you first access Ontopoly from Ontopia, you are taken to the Topic Map Index Page, see [Figure:
Ontopoly Topic Map Index Page](#ontopoly-topic-map-index-page). On the left, is a column for
**Ontopoly Topic Maps**, in the middle is the list of **Other Topic Maps** (also referred to as
"non-Ontopoly topic maps"), and on the right is the area for creating new topic maps. Another
column, **Missing Topic Maps**, will also appear on this page if an Ontopoly topic map has been
deleted from outside Ontopoly. For more information on deleting Ontopoly topic maps, please see
[Deleting a topic map](#deleting-a-topic-map).

![Ontopoly Topic Map Index Page](images/doc_welcome_page.png "Ontopoly Topic Map Index Page")

Ontopoly imports topic maps in the XTM 1.0 and 2.0, CTM, LTM, and TM/XML syntaxes; it will also
import RDF. By default Ontopoly creates topic maps as XTM files in the Omnigator's `topicmaps/`
directory. For information on exporting from Ontopoly, see [Exporting a topic
map](#exporting-a-topic-map).

##### Ontopoly topic maps #####

A topic map created in Ontopoly (an *Ontopoly topic map*) will differ from one created outside of it
(a *non-Ontopoly topic map*). An Ontopoly topic map carries along with it topics that let it
interact with the Ontopoly application and topics that define the schema (the *system topics*). You
can always export a topic map from Ontopoly to remove the system topics, but they are needed for the
topic map to be understood within the application. (It's the system topics that make it possible for
Ontopoly to automatically configure its instance editor for maximum ease of use.) Similarly,
pre-existing non-Ontopoly topic maps will need these system topics to be added. Ontopoly
automatically adds them when opening a non-Ontopoly topic map.

In the situation where you are trying to load an Ontopoly topic map using an older versjon of the
ontology, you will be forward to an upgrade page. If you want to perform the upgrade click the
**OK** button. Otherwise click **Cancel**. Once the upgrade is done you will be forwarded to the
Type Type Index Page.

![Conversion page](images/open-topicmap-upgrade.png "Conversion page")

##### Opening a non-Ontopoly topic map #####

If you try to open a non-Ontopoly topic map, you will be forwarded to the conversion page, which
looks something like this:

![Conversion page](images/open-topicmap-convert.png "Conversion page")

Opening a non-Ontopoly topic map converts it to an Ontopoly topic map and creates an index in the
process (which may take several minutes). When you click on a non-Ontopoly topic map, you will get
information about the conversion process. If the topic map contains features not supported by
Ontopoly (see [Scope of use](#scope-of-use)), you will see a warning and a list of the unsupported
features that are used in the topic map. There are options to update your existing topic map or
create a copy of it. After this decision, you are taken to the Topic Type Configuration
Page.

During the conversion, Ontopoly makes decisions about the ontology, based on what it finds in the
topic map, and generates the strictest possible schema. Sometimes it will be stricter than
necessary. For example, if occurrences of a particular type (say, *email*) never occur more than
once for any *person* topic, then Ontopoly may create a rule allowing a maximum of one *email*
occurrence per *person* topic. You may want to relax the rule, however, using Ontopoly's ontology
editor, in order to allow for the possibility of multiple *email* occurrences in the future. For
this reason you should always examine the ontology generated by Ontopoly when importing an external
topic map, and adjust it to reflect the true intent behind the topic map.

##### Creating a new Ontopoly topic map #####

Use the *Name* field in the right hand column of the page to create a new topic map. After naming
the topic map, you are taken to the Topic Type Configuration Page. The name you enter will be used
for the name of the topic map and will appear in the left-hand column on the Topic Map Index Page
when subsequently accessed. (You will be able to change it later, if you like, see [Topic Map
Description Page](#topic-map-description-page).) The name will also be used to generate a file name,
with the extension `.xtm` being added automatically.

#### Our example topic map ####

A simple topic map example will be used throughout the next two sections to illustrate Ontopoly's
functionality. It is a topic map that captures information about artists, the albums they have made,
and tracks on the album. We've called it *Jill's Music* and it's based on an ontology called
*MyMusic*; both are included in the Ontopoly distribution.

So, why wait? Go on now to section [Using the Type Configuration
Pages](#using-the-type-configuration-pages) and start creating your first topic map in
Ontopoly!

### Using the Type Configuration Pages ###

Each topic map you create will be about some domain of knowledge, such as your corporate intranet,
medical research, recording artists, the works of Shakespeare, etc. A topic map identifies subjects
and the relationships between those subjects. Each of the subjects will be of a certain type, e.g.,
Puccini and Verdi are composers, La Scala and Fenice are opera houses, Milan and Venice are cities,
etc.

Using Ontopoly's Type Configuration Pages, you will create the *typing topics* that will control
your topic map: topic, association, occurrence, role and name types. You will also create the rules
for how the typing topics are used together.

To provide a practical introduction to Ontopoly's functionality, we've created an ontology for a
music organization topic map, *MyMusic*, and an example topic map that uses that ontology, *Jill's
Music*.

Here are the topic types we will be working with:

````
Artist
   Group
   Individual Artist
Track
````

> **Note**
The indentation indicates that Group and Individual Artist are subtypes (or subclasses) of Artist.

In addition, we have defined the following association types:

````
Album created by
Belongs to album
Is a Member of
````

#### Type Index Pages ####

When you open an existing or newly created topic map, you are taken to the Topic Type Index Page,
see [Figure: Topic Type Index Page](#topic-type-index-page). Here you'll see menu buttons for each
kind of typing topic: topic types, occurrence types, association types, role types, and name types.
The **Ontology** tab is available on every page in Ontopoly. Clicking on it will always bring you to
the Topic Type Index Page. From there you can quickly access the corresponding Type Index Pages for
other kinds of typing topics, which are typically used less often.

All of the Type Index Pages are more-or-less the same. Each one presents a tree of existing types
and a field for creating a new type. The types are displayed as a type hierarchy and includes
buttons for expanding and collapsing the tree structure.

Clicking on any of the typing topics (or creating a new one) takes you to the appropriate
Configuration Page, as described below.

![Topic Type Index Page](images/doc_onto_topic_types_1.png "Topic Type Index Page")

Creating an ontology is an iterative process. Through Ontopoly's interface, you can navigate easily
between the Type Index Pages and the Type Configuration Pages. In the following we describe each
kind of Type Configuration Page in turn, but in your work you will find yourself moving back and
forth throughout the process.

#### Type Configuration Pages ####

There are five kinds of types in Topic Maps: topic types, occurrence types, association types, role
types, and name types. Each of these has its own kind of Type Configuration Page, which is accessed
via the links at the top on the Type Index Pages. Each Type Configuration Page is unique, but some
fields are common to all of them (see [Figure: Topic Type Configuration Page - default
properties](#topic-type-configuration-page-default-properties)):

*  **Name**: Editable name of the typing topic.
*  **Subject identifier**: The (Published) Subject Identifier of the typing topic. Its value must be a
   URI. The ![images/expand_all.gif](images/expand_all.gif) icon following this field indicates that
   you can create more than one. A subject identifier is not required, but is good practice. For more
   information on using PSIs, please see the 
   [OASIS Recommendations](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/3050/pubsubj-pt1-1.02-cs.pdf).
*  **Description**: Field for defining and documenting the topic type. We recommend that you use this
   field extensively to capture your intentions regarding the role of this type in your
   ontology.

The following two fields appear on the Advanced view panel for all types:

*  **Read-only**: You may create typing topics that can only be read. The instance author will be able
   to choose such a topic type and read what is in it, but no instances may be
   created.
*  **Hidden**: In some cases topic types should only be seen by the ontology designer, and that's the
   perfect use of this choice as the topic will not be available in the instance
   editor.

The following sections provide more detail on each kind of Type Configuration Page.

#### Configuring topic types ####

The Topic Type Index is shown in [Figure: Topic Type Index Page](#topic-type-index-page). From here
you can enter a name for a new topic type in the field and then click **Create**, or you can choose
an existing topic type to view or edit. Our example already contains an ontology which has been
partially populated, so we will go straight to the Topic Type Configuration Page for a pre-existing
type, *Artist*.

##### Topic Type Configuration Page #####

Configuration pages control what the instance authors will see as they create topics of a given
type. Let's look at the Topic Type Configuration Page in [Figure: Topic Type Configuration Page -
default properties](#topic-type-configuration-page-default-properties).

The main portion of the page is divided into three parts: the top part lists the core properties of
the typing topic (its name, subject identifier and description fields plus abstract, superclass and
subclass fields which are specific to topic types); the lower part of the page lists those
properties, or "fields" (i.e., names, identifiers, occurrences, and associations), that will apply
to instances of the type; the right part contains operations, that can be performed on the topic
type, and links to other relevant pages.

The properties that are common to all typing topics and thus occur on all Configuration Pages were
described above in [Type Configuration Pages](#type-configuration-pages). This applies to **Name**,
**Subject identifier**, **Description**, **Read-only**, and **Hidden**. The first three fields are
shown in the Default view panel and the last two on the Advanced view panel. The following
additional properties are specific to topic types:

##### Properties of the typing topic (Default view panel) #####

![Topic Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_topic_types_config.png "Topic Type Configuration Page - default properties")

*  **Abstract**: Check this box if you want to use this typing topic as a model for other topics, but
   don't want a user to create any instances of it directly. Typically, an abstract topic will be a
   supertype in a hierarchy of topics. In our example, we have a two-tier hierarchy where *Artist* is
   the supertype and *Individual Artist* and *Group* are subtypes. We will not want authors to create
   instances of *Artist*, only of its subtypes. However, having the *Artist* supertype is useful
   because, once we define it, its subtypes will inherit all of its fields. If one subtype requires
   fields not needed by the other subtypes, those fields can be added at subtype
   level.
*  **Superclass**: A drop down list of topics from which to choose a supertype (i.e., a parent in the
   type hierarchy) for the current topic. (In our example there is no supertype, because *Artist* is at
   the top of the hierarchy and thus has no parent.)
*  **Subclass**: A list of topics of which this topic is the supertype (i.e., parent in the type
   hierarchy). In our example, although *Artist* has no supertype, it does have two subtypes, each of
   which is highlighted as a link that can take you to the corresponding Type Configuration Page. After
   the last subtype, there is a ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon that can be used to create
   another topic type which will automatically become a subtype of the current topic
   type.

    Note that the type hierarchy can be constructed from two directions: upwards (by assigning the
    supertype of each topic type), or downwards (by specifying its subtypes). You can also use a
    combination of the two approaches. This hierarchy can be made visible on the Topic Type Index Page
    by clicking on **Expand all nodes** (see [Figure: Topic Type Index Page](#topic-type-index-page)).

##### Properties of the typing topic (Advanced view panel) #####

![Topic Type Configuration Page - advanced properties](images/doc_topic_types_config_advanced.png "Topic Type Configuration Page - advanced properties")

*  **Large instance set**: Some topic types have such a large set of instances that you do not want the
   user to be able to display the entire list, because this would take too long to render, and the
   pages would be too big. Checking this box makes Ontopoly turn off the listing feature, and would
   require the user to search for instance topics instead.
*  **Hierarchical associations**: Here you can select a number of association types that together form
   a hierarchy of the instances of this topic type. The only association types which can be selected
   here are those which on the Association Type Configuration Page (see [Association Type Configuration
   Page](#association-type-configuration-page)) are defined as being hierarchical. The effect of this
   setting is to get topics of this type presented in a tree view on the Instance Index Page (see
   [Instance Index Pages](#instance-index-pages)) and in the Topic Selection Dialog (see [Assigning
   topics to associations](#assigning-topics-to-associations)).
*  **Hierarchy definition query**: Sometimes you will want to define your own hierarchy for the
   instances of a topic type without using the default hierarchy pattern. For those situations you can
   specify a tolog query that retrieves the preferred hierarchy. The query should return two columns,
   which contains all the parent/child combinations in the hierarchy/tree. The first column must
   contain the parents and the second column must contain the children. Topics with no parents and no
   children must return null in the parent column and itself in the child column. The query should also
   sort first by the parent column and then by the child column. The query can take one parameter,
   `%topicType%`, which is the topic type itself. There are no restrictions on the column
   names.

##### Assigning new fields #####

![Topic Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor.png "Topic Type Configuration Page - default properties")

In the lower part of the Topic Type Configuration Page (in the default view) you can define and add
fields to the topic for use in the Instance Editing Pages. The fields shown here are the fields that
are already assigned to the topic type. The **Names**, **Occurrences**, **Associations**, and
**Identities** links at the top will allow you to assign new fields and the
![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon will let you create a new field by creating a new
ontology type. New fields will be placed at the bottom of the fields list.

 *  **Names**: Clicking this label will display a list of available name types on the right side. From
    this list you can assign a new field for the given name type by clicking the
    ![images/assign-field.gif](images/assign-field.gif) icon. Only name types not already assigned to
    this topic type will be shown in the list. By default, there is just one name type: *Name*, which is
    for general-purpose, "untyped" names. In our sample topic map the *Name* name is already assigned,
    but we get another name *Nickname* that we can assign from the list.

    You can create new name types by clicking the ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon. This
    will also assign a new name field and then take you to the Name Type Configuration Page, see
    [Configuring name types](#configuring-name-types).

    ![images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_names.png](images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_names.png)

 *  **Occurrences**: Clicking this label will display a list of available occurrence types on the right
    side. From this list you can assign a new field for the given occurrence type by clicking the
    ![images/assign-field.gif](images/assign-field.gif) icon. Only occurrence types not already assigned
    to this topic type will be shown in the list. By default, there are three predefined occurrence
    types: *Creator*, *Description*, and *Version*. In our sample topic map only *Creator* and *Version*
    shows up in the list as *Description* has already been assigned.

    You can create new occurrence types by clicking the ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon.
    This will also assign a new occurrence field and then take you to the Occurrence Type Configuration
    Page, see [Configuring occurrence types](#configuring-occurrence-types).
	
    ![images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_occurrences.png](images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_occurrences.png)

 *  **Associations**: Clicking this label will display a list of available association types on the
    right side. The list will also show information about what kind of topic can be found at the other
    end of the associations. From this list you can assign a new field for the given association type by
    clicking the ![images/assign-field.gif](images/assign-field.gif) icon. Only association types not
    already assigned to this topic type will be shown in the list. By default there are no predefined
    association types. In our sample topic map *Belongs to album*, *Created album*, *Has/had as Members*
    and *Is/was a Member of* shows up in the list. *Contains track* and *Album created by* has already
    been assigned.

    You can create new association types by clicking the ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon.
    This will also assign a new role field and an association field and then take you to the Association
    Type Configuration Page, see [Configuring association
    types](#configuring-association-types).

    In the case where a topic might play both roles, such as *parent* and *child* in a *parent-child*
    association, each role (field) should be selected in turn so that both are available fields on the
    Instance Editing Page.

    ![images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_associations.png](images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_associations.png)

 *  **Identities**: Clicking this label will display a list of available identity types on the right
    side. From this list you can assign a new field for the given identity type by clicking the
    ![images/assign-field.gif](images/assign-field.gif) icon. Only identity types not already assigned
    to this topic type will be shown in the list. By default, there are three predefined identity types:
    *Subject identifier*, *Subject locator*, and *Item identifier*. In our sample topic map only
    *Subject locator* and *Item identifier* shows up in the list as *Subject identifier* has already
    been assigned.
    
	You cannot create new identity types at this time.
    
	If topics of this type represent information resources (which would probably be the case for the
    topic type *Document*, for example), the type can be assigned a *Subject locator* field, otherwise
    the type can (and, in many cases, should) be assigned a *Subject identifier* field. For more
    information on the use of subject identifiers and subject locators, see the 
    [OASIS Recommendations](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/3050/pubsubj-pt1-1.02-cs.pdf).

    ![images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_identities.png](images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_identities.png)

##### Editing existing fields #####

Now let's move on down to the existing fields. As you can see from the figure below the *Artist*
topic type has five fields assigned. Each field is displayed in a separate table
row.

![images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_existing.png](images/doc_topic_types_fields_editor_existing.png)

At the left you find the ![images/dnd.gif](images/dnd.gif) icon. Use this icon to reorder the
fields. Drag the icon on top of the field that you want the dragged field to be ordered after. Note
that in order to make a field become the first field you have to first drag it on top of the first
field and then afterwards drag the first field on top of the new second field.

The ![images/goto-details.gif](images/goto-details.gif) icon will let you edit the topic that
represents the field. Clicking this icon will navigate to the instance page of the field. This page
will reveal more detailed information about the field.

Next is the field label. The label is a link that lets you navigate to the name type, occurrence
type, association type or identity type topics declared by the field.

To the right of the field label is the value type of the field. This will tell you what kind of
values can be assigned to this field. In our example the *Name* is a name string, the *Subject
identifier* is a URI, and the *Description* is a string. The association fields shows the kind of
topics that can be associated through the field. The *Contains track* can contain *Track*s and the
*Album created by* can contain *Artist*s. If the value type is *Many* then multiple topic types can
be associated through that field. Hold the mouse over the *Many* label to see which topic types that
is.

The drop-down list shows the cardinality choices for the number of times the field can or must be
used in the Instance Editing Page. There are four possible choices: *Exactly one*, *One or more*,
*Zero or more*, and *Zero or one*.

Each line ends with the ![images/remove.gif](images/remove.gif) icon, which is used to remove
fields, i.e. unassign them. Removing a field will make it once more available as a option to
reassign. If the icon is shown instead of the remove icon then it means that the field has been
assigned to a supertype. Clicking the icon will navigate to the supertype that declares the field.
The field can then be removed there instead.

We now know how to add fields to a topic type. However, most of these fields have to be defined by
the ontology designer through the use of the other Configuration Pages, so let's move
on.

#### Configuring occurrence types ####

Occurrences can refer to resources external to the topic map, such as a web page, or they can be
internal to the topic map, in which case they can be thought of as attributes (or properties) of the
subject that the topic represents. You can create new occurrence types or choose one for edit from
the Occurrence Type Index, see [Figure: Occurrence Type Index Page](#occurrence-type-index-page),
which will take you to the Occurrence Type Configuration Page, see [Figure: Occurrence Type
Configuration Page - default
properties](#occurrence-type-configuration-page-default-properties).

![Occurrence Type Index Page](images/doc_onto_occur_types.png "Occurrence Type Index Page")

##### Occurrence Type Configuration Page #####

The Occurrence Type Configuration Page for *Description* looks as follows:

![Occurrence Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_occur_config_1.png "Occurrence Type Configuration Page - default properties")

The core properties of the occurrence type topic are shown in the upper part of the page; the lower
part contains the information about how fields of this type will be used when editing instances. The
properties of the occurrence field is displayed in the grey **Occurrence field** field box. This box
represents the field that is assigned to topic types. The actual topic types that is assigned the
field (and indirectly the occurrence type) can be seen in the **Used by**
field.

Core properties common to all typing topics are described in [Type Configuration
Pages](#type-configuration-pages).

##### Properties of the occurrence field (Default view panel) #####

*  **Name**: This is the name of the field. The value will be used to display the label of the field in
   the user interface. If no value is given the name of the occurrence type will be
   used.
*  **Data type**: This field describes the value type of the occurrence field. The value type can be
   any of the following:
    *  **String**: a string value (the default).
    *  **URI**: a web address.
    *  **Date**: a date value, matching the `YYYY-MM-DD` pattern. Values can be selected using a calendar
   widget.
    *  **Datetime**: a datetime value, matching the `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` pattern. Instance authors are
   given a calendar widget.
    *  **Number**: a numeric value, either an integer (like `42`) or a decimal (like `-4.2`), with an
   optional negative sign in front.
    *  **HTML**: an HTML document or an HTML fragment. HTML content will be edited using a rich text
   editor.
    *  **Image**: an image. Images can be uploaded via a file upload widget.
*  **Used by**: If the occurrence field has been assigned by any topic types, they are listed here,
   highlighted as links to their Configuration Pages.
*  **Cardinality**: The field specifies the cardinality of the field. The cardinality specifies the
   number of times the field can or must be used in the Instance Editing Page. There are four possible
   choices: *Exactly one*, *One or more*, *Zero or more*, and *Zero or one*. The default is *Zero or
   more*.

As the occurrence fields are ones in which the author will be providing content rather than picking
topic names or role labels, it is necessary for the ontology designer to describe the dimensions
that the field will be given on the Instance Editing Page. Two fields are provided for this
purpose:

*  **Width**: in characters (the default is 50)
*  **Depth**: in rows (the default is 1)

##### Properties of the occurrence field (Advanced view panel) #####

![Occurrence Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_occur_config_1_advanced.png "Occurrence Type Configuration Page - default properties")

The occurrence type's Advanced view panel contains only the two standard *Read-only* and *Hidden*
fields.

#### Configuring association types ####

Associations describe a relationship that can or must exist between topics. You can create new
association types or choose one for edit from the Association Type Index, see [Figure: Association
Type Index Page](#association-type-index-page), which will take you to the Association Type
Configuration Page, see [Figure: Association Type Configuration Page - default
properties](#association-type-configuration-page-default-properties)

![Association Type Index Page](images/doc_onto_assoc_types_1.png "Association Type Index Page")

Most associations are binary, that is, there are two role players, such as in parent-child or
employer-employee relationships. You can also create associations with only one role player, or with
three or more role players. We will focus on binary associations for the scope of this
document.

Binary associations are bi-directional. For example, an association named *composed-by* might sound
like it is only uni-directional, i.e., Tosca is composed by Puccini. However, it also represents the
relationship expressed as, for example, Puccini composed Tosca. Topic Maps accomplishes this
bi-directionality, unambiguously, by assigning roles to the players. The relationship expressed in
[Figure: Associations are bi-directional](#associations-are-bi-directional) can be described as, "In
the composed-by relationship, the role of composer is played by Puccini and the role of work is
played by Tosca."

![Associations are bi-directional](images/doc_assoc_bidirectional.png "Associations are bi-directional")

Ontopoly's Association Type Configuration Page helps you to define the association type, roles their
role types and their corresponding role player types, and the labels for role fields as seen from
the perspective of each role player.

##### Association Type Configuration Page #####

The Association Type Configuration Page for *Album created by* looks as follows:

![Association Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_assoc_config_1.png "Association Type Configuration Page - default properties")

The core properties of the association type are again shown in the upper part of the page; the lower
part contains information relating to the role fields declared for the associaion
type.

Core properties common to all typing topics are described in [Type Configuration
Pages](#type-configuration-pages).

##### Properties of the typing topic (Default view panel) #####

The Association Type Configuration Page contains one new checkbox in the top portion of the form,
**Symmetric**, and an association field labelled **Association field**.

*  **Symmetric**: A symmetric relation is one which is the same from both (or all) directions. The
   teacher/pupil relation is not symmetric, because the two participants are doing different things,
   whereas the is-neighbour relation is symmetric, since there's no difference between the two
   neighbours. In one sense, you can say the participants in a symmetric relationship are equal, which
   does not hold for created-by, killed-by, eaten-by, but does hold for works-with, is-a-friend-of,
   is-a-sibling-of, is-the-spouse-of, etc.
*  **Association field**: This is the relation between the association type and its association fields.
   Inside each association field, of which there is normally only one, there is another field called
   **Roles** that references the individual role fields. The role field box represents the field that
   is assigned to topic types. The actual topic types that is assigned the field (and indirectly the
   role type and association type) can be seen in the Used by field. In our example the association
   type has one association field which has two role fields.

###### Roles ######

In general, there is one role box for each role player. In most cases, there will be two role
players and therefore two role boxes. In symmetric associations (and unary associations), there is
only one role box. It is also possible to have more than two role players (in what are known as
"n-ary associations"); an example of a ternary association (one with three role players) would be a
perpetrator, a victim, and a cause of death in a "killed / killed-by"
association.

Each role box has four fields:

*  **Name**: You can define a string as the label that will be seen from the perspective of this role.
   For example, in a parent-child relationship, from the perspective of the parent role, the label
   might be "is the parent of", while from the perspective of the child role, the label would be "is
   the child of".
*  **Role type**: The values available in the drop-down correlate to role type topics. You can create
   new role types directly from this page by using the ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon,
   which will take you to a new Role Type Configuration Page, see [Configuring role
   types](#configuring-role-types).
*  **Used by**: Use the drop-down list to choose the appropriate topic type to play this role. Note
   that this is a repeatable field as multiple topic types may play the same role. New topic types can
   be created directly from this page using the ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon. Once you
   choose **Confirm**, the drop-down box is replaced by a link to the chosen topic type. The
   ![images/expand_all.gif](images/expand_all.gif) icon generates another drop-down box for additional
   choices.
*  **Cardinality**: The field specifies the cardinality of the field. The cardinality specifies the
   number of times the field can or must be used in the Instance Editing Page. There are four possible
   choices: *Exactly one*, *One or more*, *Zero or more*, and *Zero or one*. The default is *Zero or
   more*.
*  **Interface control**: Choose between providing instance authors with a drop-down list of valid
   topic types, or a search box, or a browse window, or an auto-complete input
   field.

Once you have created an association type, visit the Topic Type Configuration Pages of the topics
that play roles to make sure the cardinality for the use of the association is correct. These should
be reviewed from the perspective of each role player as they may differ, e.g., a student goes to one
school ( *Exactly one* ), but a school may have many students ( *One or more* ).

##### Properties of the typing topic (Advanced view panel) #####

![Association Type Configuration Page - advanced properties](images/doc_assoc_config_1_advanced.png "Association Type Configuration Page - advanced properties")

This section allows you to configure an association type as being hierarchical. To do this, you must
also set the role types correctly, so that Ontopoly knows which role is the parent role and which is
the child role. The purpose of this to enable Ontopoly to show you the hierarchy formed by these
associations.

An example might be the hierarchy formed by the geographical "contained in" association. The parent
role here would be "container" and the child role would be "containee". Setting this up would allow
you to browse your collection of geographic places as a tree on the Instance Index Page (see
[Instance Index Pages](#instance-index-pages)) and in the Topic Selection Dialog (see [Assigning
topics to associations](#assigning-topics-to-associations)). Another example might be the
broader/narrower relationship from taxonomies and thesauri, which you can find in the UK Government
Category List, which comes with Ontopoly.

Note that to register an association type as hierarchical one must add the *Hierarchical Relation
Type* topic type to the association type. At the moment this can only be done in Administrator mode,
and using the **Add or remove topic type** action item on the right side of the
page.

*  **Superordinate for**: Here you specify the role type that is the parent role.
*  **Subordinate for**: Here you specify the role type that is the child role.
*  **Hierarchical for**: Not all players should be part of a hierarchy, so here you can specify the
   topic types for which this associaion type should be considered hierarchical.

#### Configuring role types ####

Role types are used in associations to represent the semantics of why a topic participates in an
association. For role types one either selects an existing topic type (e.g. "opera") or one creates
a topic that represents a more specific role (e.g. "composer"), i.e. something that describes what
it means for a topic to be part of the role. As you can see one might choose a role type that
represents what the player does as opposed to what the person inherently is. Beethoven is a person,
but he is also composer because he composed something. Topic types should be universally valid for
the topic. Role types on the other hand can, and often should, be more context dependent. Role types
should be as generic as possible so that they can easily be reused across association types. For
example, whether you have a "composer/opera", "author/book", or "artist/painting" association, the
roles the topics play in all three of these examples might be "creator" and "creation", even though
the association types could be different.

You can create new role types or choose one for edit from the Role Type Index page, see [Figure:
Role Type Index Page](#role-type-index-page), which will take you to the Role Type Configuration
Page, see [Figure: Role Type Configuration Page - default
properties](#role-type-configuration-page-default-properties).

![Role Type Index Page](images/doc_onto_role_types_1.png "Role Type Index Page")

##### Role Type Configuration Page #####

In our sample topic map there is only one topic, *Member*, that is specifically registered as a role
type. All other role types used in the topic map are topic types. The Role Type Configuration Page
for *Member* looks as follows:

![Role Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_role_config_1.png "Role Type Configuration Page - default properties")

Core properties common to all typing topics are described in [Type Configuration
Pages](#type-configuration-pages).

##### Properties of the typing topic (Default view panel) #####

There are not really any new properties here. The first three are core properties common to all
typing topics. The **Role field** represents the relation between the role type and the role fields
in which it has been declared. The properties of the role field we have already seen in
[Roles](#roles).

##### Properties of the typing topic (Advanced view panel) #####

![Role Type Configuration Page - advanced properties](images/doc_role_config_1_advanced.png "Role Type Configuration Page - advanced properties")

The two new fields on this page are the inverse of the **Superordinate role type** and **Subordinate
role type** fields we saw in [Properties of the typing topic (Advanced view
panel)](#properties-of-the-typing-topic-(advanced-view-panel)).

*  **Superordinate role type for**: Here you specify the association type for which this role type is
   the parent role.
*  **Subordinate role type for**: Here you specify the association type for which this role type is the
   child role.

#### Configuring name types ####

Name types are used to define the names of topics in various contexts. Frequently used name types
include **nickname** and **short**, but one of the most popular uses is to provide the name of the
topic in multiple languages. You can create new name types or choose one for edit from the Name Type
Index, see [Figure: Name Type Index Page](#name-type-index-page), which will take you to the Name
Type Configuration Page, see [Figure: Name Type Configuration Page - default
properties](#name-type-configuration-page-default-properties)

![Name Type Index Page](images/doc_onto_name_types_1.png "Name Type Index Page")

##### Name Type Configuration Page (Default view panel) #####

The Name Type Configuration Page for *Nickname* looks as follows:

![Name Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_name_config_1.png "Name Type Configuration Page - default properties")

Core properties common to all typing topics are described in [Type Configuration
Pages](#type-configuration-pages).

*  **Name**: This is the name of the field. The value will be used to display the label of the field in
   the user interface. If no value is given the name of the name type will be
   used.
*  **Used by**: If the name field has been assigned by any topic types, they are listed here,
   highlighted as links to their Configuration Pages.
*  **Cardinality**: The field specifies the cardinality of the field. The cardinality specifies the
   number of times the field can or must be used in the Instance Editing Page. There are four possible
   choices: *Exactly one*, *One or more*, *Zero or more*, and *Zero or one*. The default is *Zero or
   more*.

##### Name Type Configuration Page (Advanced view panel) #####

![Name Type Configuration Page - default properties](images/doc_name_config_1_advanced.png "Name Type Configuration Page - default properties")

There are no new properties in the advanced view outside of the core commmon properties described in
[Type Configuration Pages](#type-configuration-pages).

#### Topic Map Description Page ####

Once you are within a topic map, you can choose to enter descriptive information about it. Use the
**Description** tab to access the Description Page (see [Figure: Topic Map Description
Page](#topic-map-description-page)).

This page can be used to change the name of the topic map, but the file name will remain the same as
assigned when creating it.

![Topic Map Description Page](images/doc_config_page.png "Topic Map Description Page")

There are four editable fields:

*  **Name**: the name of the topic map
*  **Description**: a description of the topic map as a whole
*  **Creator**: the person, group, or company creating the ontology or topic map
*  **Version**: a user-designated version number

##### Deleting a topic map #####

The **Delete** button on the Description Page removes the topic map from the list of Ontopoly Topic
Maps and physically removes the file from the disk.

> **Note**
> Ontopoly keeps track of your Ontopoly topic maps. Manually deleting an Ontopoly topic map from the
> file system (as opposed to using the **Delete** button on the Description Page) will result in the
> display of a **Missing Topic Maps** column on the Topic Map Index Page. Therefore, it is best
> practice only to delete Ontopoly topic maps through the **Delete** button on the **Description**
> tab.

Clicking the **Delete** button will open up a confirmation window. Choose **OK** to delete the topic
map. You will then be taken to the start page (see [Scope of use](#scope-of-use)). Clicking the
**Cancel** button will cancel the operation and close the confirmation window.

![Deletion confirmation window](images/doc_config_page_delete_confirm.png "Deletion confirmation window")

##### Enabling shortcuts #####

The **Enable shortcuts** action item on right-hand side of the Description Page ([Figure: Topic Map
Description Page](#topic-map-description-page)) will enable some useful shortcuts in the user
interface. The field labels in the editing pages will become links. The
![images/goto-details.gif](images/goto-details.gif) icon will let you go directly to the topic that
represents the field. Clicking the field label will navigate to the name type, occurrence type,
association type or identity type topics declared by the field. You can later disable shortcuts by
clicking the button again.

Here is an example of what an editing page looks like with shortcuts enabled:

![Topic Type Configuration Page with shortcuts enabled](images/doc_topic_types_config_shortcuts.png "Topic Type Configuration Page with shortcuts enabled")

##### Ontology annotation #####

The **Enable ontology annotation** action item on right-hand side of the Description Page ([Figure:
Topic Map Description Page](#topic-map-description-page)) turns on ontology annotation, which is a
very powerful feature, but one that can be a little confusing at first. The basic idea is that the
normal Ontopoly (without this feature) allows you to say anything you want about instance topics,
but for typing topics you are pretty much restricted to names, subject identifiers, and the
description field. This may not sound like much of a problem, but there are a lot of useful things
that can be done if you can annotate your ontology topics.

Generally, ontology annotation enables you to build more dynamic applications, by moving logic out
of your code and into the topic map. To take a trivial example, imagine building a search page for
your topic map. On this page you'll need to display things like "found X people", "found Y
documents", etc, and to do this you need to display the plural names of the topic types. You can of
course do this with a big multi-way test (if current topic type is "person", display "people"). But
the easiest way is to make a name type "Plural name" and to give each topic type such a
name.

With ontology annotation this is easy. Once you turn ontology annotation on, the topic types "Topic
type", "Association type", etc show up in the list of topic types. This lets you give them fields in
the same way as normal topic types, and you can edit them in the normal way.

This what the Topic Types Index Page looks like with annotation enabled. The ontology types are
displayed in italic.

![Topic Type Index Page with annotation enabled](images/doc_onto_topic_types_annotation.png "Topic Type Index Page with annotation enabled")

##### Administration mode #####

The **Enable administration mode** action item on right-hand side of the Description Page ([Figure:
Topic Map Description Page](#topic-map-description-page)) turns on admistration mode, which is an
extremely powerful feature as it gives you access to everything in the topic map, including the
Ontopoly model itself.

> **Warning**
> Be careful when using this feature.

As you can see there is a lot of new topic types visible on the Topic Types Index Page when
administration mode is enabled:

![Topic Type Index Page with administration mode enabled](images/doc_onto_topic_types_administration.png "Topic Type Index Page with administration mode enabled")

#### Exporting a topic map ####

The Export Page (see [Figure: Export Page](#export-page)) is accessed via the **Admin** tab. The
desired export format (LTM, XTM 1.0, XTM 2.0, or RDF) is chosen via radio
buttons.

![Export Page](images/doc_export_page.png "Export Page")

You can choose to export the topic map with or without the system topics (those topics that make up
the constraints or rules for using the ontology). In general, other downstream applications such as
browsers will neither understand nor need the schema topics. The export is done to a browser window
and can be saved from there.

#### Saving a topic map ####

Any modifications made in an editing page will be sent to the server immediately and written into
the topic map. The application is AJAX based, so modification are sent to the server as soon as they
are made. If an error occurs, the user may be redirected to a page showing the errors instead of the
intended destination.

The back button will work in the way it generally does on the web, and will return to the previous
page or to the previous state of the current page. Note that previous page may be slightly out of
date if any changes were made to the topic since it was displayed the first
time.

> __Important__ Changes to your topic map are not automatically persisted to disk on the server
> unless you are using Ontopoly with the relational database backend of the Ontopia Knowledge Suite.
> With the free version of Ontopoly, which operates in-memory, it is necessary to press the Save
> button in order to save the topic map to disk: pressing the Confirm does not save to disk; it merely
> submits the current page and updates the topic map in memory.

### Using Instance Editing Pages ###

The Instance Editing Pages are used to create instance topics conforming to the ontology and
constraints developed using the Type Configuration Pages.

#### Topic Type Index Page ####

When you choose the **Instances** tab, you will land at the instance index of all topic types. If
your ontology includes a type hierarchy, you will be able to show the complete tree by clicking on
**Expand all nodes**, with the result as shown in [Figure: Topic Type Index
Page](#topic-type-index-page). Topic types that are allowed to have instances are shown as
links.

![Topic Type Index Page](images/doc_inst_topic_types_1.png "Topic Type Index Page")

From this index, you can choose a topic type to see a list of instance topics of that type (see
[Figure: Instance Index Page](#instance-index-page)).

##### Instance Index Pages #####

![Instance Index Page](images/doc_inst_topic_types_2.png "Instance Index Page")

Choose an existing instance topic from the Instance Index, or **Create** a new instance, to access
the Instance Editing Page.

##### Instance Editing Page #####

The Instance Editing Page is used to edit individual instance topics, and is the most central page
in Ontopoly, since most editing will happen here. The contents on the page are entirely determined
by the ontology and schema for the topic type (see [Topic Type Configuration
Page](#topic-type-configuration-page) for more on the Topic Type Configuration Page). All the
allowable fields for a topic type are available on the Instance Editing Page, along with the
allowable values for those fields.

![Instance Editing Page](images/doc_inst_topic_types_3.png "Instance Editing Page")

When editing a topic there may be validation errors. These usually occur when values are missing or
when there are too many values for a given field. The error messages shows up right above the
individual field. The topic map can be saved while there are validation errors.

![Field with validation error](images/doc_required_edits.png "Field with validation error")

##### Changing a topic's type #####

Frequently, it is easier to create a new instance from another instance, rather than going back to
the Instance Index Page. However the next instance to be created might be of a different type than
the current one. In such cases, the instance author can use the **Change the topic type** choice in
the Action Items Panel immediately upon accessing the new Instance Editing Page, picking the new
type from the drop-down box.

There are other times when changing the topic type will be useful. For example, in an employee
database, employees might be typed by their status, such as probationary, tenured, retired, etc. As
their status changes, their topic type might change as well.

Changing a topic's type can lead to a number of knock-on effects that require action. For
illustration purposes in [Figure: Messages when changing a topic's
type](#messages-when-changing-a-topic's-type), the *Individual Artist* type topic *Sir Paul
McCartney* has been changed to an *Album* type topic. Now a new set of fields will be displayed for
the topic. Some of the fields are the same: *Name*, *Subject identifier* and *Description*, while
*Contains track* and *Album created by* replaces *Nickname*, *Is/was a Member of* and *Created
album*. The user interface now complains that information is missing in the *Contains track*. Note
that the information from the old fields are still stored on the topic, but the fields are not
presented in the user interface. Changing the topic type back to *Individual artist* will again show
the original fields with the original values.

![Messages when changing a topic's type](images/doc_change_type.png "Messages when changing a topic's type")

##### Assigning topics to associations #####

You can create new topics by clicking the ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif) icon. If there are
multiple topic types that can participate in the association, then you will be presented with a
context menu, like the one below, where you can select the topic type of the new
instance.

![Create player context menu](images/association-create-player-context-menu.png "Create player context menu")

A new instance will then be created and associated to the current topic. A popup window will then
open and let you edit some basic information about the new instance. Close the popup by clicking the
**OK** button or the **X** in the top right corner.

![Create player popup window](images/association-create-player.png "Create player popup window")

By default topics at the other end of associations are selected using drop-down boxes, but this can
be changed in the configuration of the association type in the **Interface control** field. The
alternative for interface control are: **Drop-down list**, **Search dialog**, **Browse dialog**, and
**Auto-complete**.

This is what the default drop-down list looks like. You may have to press
![images/add.gif](images/add.gif) before it shows up.

![A drop-down list](images/drop-down-list.png "A drop-down list")

The interface controls **Search dialog** and **Browse dialog** use a popup dialog where the user can
either search for the topic to associate with, or browse for it.

If we change the example topic map so that to select an album created by an artist you have to use
the dialog, the instance editing page from [Figure: Instance Editing Page](#instance-editing-page)
would have a little search button instead of the drop-down box.

![The search button](images/search-button.png "The search button")

Pressing the ![images/search.gif](images/search.gif) icon would open a new window as shown in the
figure below.

![The search dialog](images/search-dialog.png "The search dialog")

Here you can do a search, and create associations to the topics you find, or you can click "Browse"
and see a list of the topics you could create an association to. Below is shown the screen you get
in this case by clicking "Browse". This is also the dialog you would get if the interface control
had been **Browse dialog**.

Note that it's possible to control what shows on the browse screen by configuring the topic type.
It's possible to make the topics be shown in a hierarchy, or to make it impossible to display the
list of topics (because the list is too big). See [Properties of the typing topic (Advanced view
panel)](#properties-of-the-typing-topic-(advanced-view-panel)) for more
information.

![The browse dialog](images/browse-dialog.png "The browse dialog")

If the interface control is **Auto-complete** you will get an input text field. You may have to
press ![images/add.gif](images/add.gif) before the input field shows up. Below you can see an
example of what this interface control looks like. Once you start typing a list of matching topics
show up in a list below the input field. Note that the auto-complete field runs a full-text query to
retrieve the topics to display in the list. (Note: the syntax of a full-text query currently depends
on the full-text engine used. This is likely to change in the future.)

![The auto-complete input box](images/auto-complete.png "The auto-complete input box")

##### Editing name, occurrence, and identity fields #####

Names are always entered in a standard text input field.

> __Important__ The new field value is sent to the server as soon as the field looses its focus, so
> make sure, that when you're done editing, to click outside of the input box or press the Tab key to
> move to another field. This rule applies to all text input boxes in the
> application.

![Name field](images/name-field.png "Name field")

As mentioned in 
[Properties of the occurrence field (Default view panel)](#properties-of-the-occurrence-field-&#40;default-view-panel&#41;), 
an occurrence field have a data type. The default is *String*. Occurrences with the data types 
*String* and *Number* are displayed as a standard input text field. Here is an example:

![String and numeric occurrences](images/occurrence-datatype-default.png "String and numeric occurrences")

Identity fields and occurrences with the data type *URI* are displayed as an input text field, but
with an ![images/goto.gif](images/goto.gif) icon next to it. Clicking the icon will open the URI in
the web browser.

![URI occurrences (and identity fields)](images/occurrence-datatype-uri.png "URI occurrences (and identity fields)")

Occurrences with the data types *Date* and *Datetime* are displayed as a standard input text field,
but with a date picker widget attached.

![Date and datetime occurrences](images/occurrence-datatype-date.png "Date and datetime occurrences")

HTML occurrences can be edited using an embedded HTML editor (currently
[TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/)). This editor provides rich formatting capabilities, but
allows you to edit the actual HTML document.

> **Warning**
> Note that this component will not automatically save your edits. Instead click the
> ![images/save-icon.png](images/save-icon.png) to have your changes saved to the
> server.

![HTML occurrences](images/occurrence-datatype-html.png "HTML occurrences")

Image occurrence fields lets you upload images and display them in the instance editor. Click the
**Choose...** button to get a file chooser widget that lets you select an image file from the file
system. Once the file has been selected, click the **Upload** to uploaded the image and create an
occurrence for it.

![Uploading an image](images/occurrence-datatype-image-upload.png "Uploading an image")

Here is an example of what the user interface looks like after an image has been uploaded:

![Image occurrences](images/occurrence-datatype-image.png "Image occurrences")

### Using Ontopoly with multiple users ###

Although Ontopoly ships in a single-user configuration, there is support for multiple users under
the hood. This support consists of:

*  Support for storing the topic map in a relational database using the RDBMS backend. This enables
   Ontopoly to scale to much larger topic maps, avoids having to explicitly save the topic map, and
   ensures that multiple users can work against the same topic map without causing data to become
   corrupt. To make use of this support the OKS Enterprise Edition is required.
*  Support for concurrent editing. This support is always enabled in all Ontopoly versions, and ensures
   through locking that two different users cannot edit the same topic at the same
   time.

### Appendix 1: User interface conventions ###

This section describes general aspects of Ontopoly's user interface.

#### Ontopoly page layout ####

Most Ontopoly pages have a similar layout. The major sections are identified in [Figure: Page
layout](#page-layout) and described below.

![Page layout](images/general_layout-annotated.png "Page layout")

##### Application navigation #####

In the upper right hand corner of all Ontopoly pages and on the Ontopia Home Page, there is an
application navigation bar.

| Item | Description | 
|---|---|
| **Home** | Returns you to the Ontopia Home Page. | 
| **Manage** | Accesses the Omnigator Manage page. _This item will eventually take the user to an common Manage Page, that can be used for Ontopoly or Omnigator._ | 
| **Feedback** | As you use Ontopoly, we hope that you will use this feedback form to send us comments as they occur to you. However, please do not use the **feedback** mechanism to report bugs. Ontopia provides a direct link to Ontobugs. | 
| **Support** | If you need an answer to a question, please use this form or send email to [support@ontopia.net](mailto:support@ontopia.net). | 
| **About** | Information about the version of Ontopoly currently in use. | 

##### Tabbed navigation #####

Once inside a topic map, there are four major tabs.

| Item | Description | 
|---|---|
| **Description** | Page where descriptive information about the current topic map as a whole can be captured, see [Topic Map Description Page](#topic-map-description-page). | 
| **Admin** | Use this page to export the topic map into a preferred serialization syntax, see [Exporting a topic map](#exporting-a-topic-map). | 
| **Ontology** | Set of pages for configuring the ontology, i.e., defining the topic, occurrence, association, role, and name type topics. When in Ontology area, a secondary set of buttons occur that provide discrete access to the preferred page, e.g., topic type, association type, etc., see [Using the Type Configuration Pages](#using-the-type-configuration-pages). | 
| **Instances** | Set of pages for creating and editing instances of topic types defined in the Ontology, see [Using Instance Editing Pages](#using-instance-editing-pages). | 

The items in the tabs are also repeated at the bottom of each page upon which the tabs occur.

##### Editing box #####

There are three items in the Editing Box:

| Item | Description | 
|---|---|
| **Open...** | Takes you back to the Topic Map Index Page. If you do not save before you use this button, all edits since your previous save will **not** be written to disk. | 
| **Save** | Saves the current topic map to disk. _Only available for in-memory topic maps._ | 
| Search box and **Find** button | Use to find the uses of a term within the open topic map.  | 

##### Topic title #####

The name of the current topic type or topic instance appears in red.

##### Action items panel #####

The item choices available in grey boxes on the right hand side of the screen are dependent on the
type of page you are viewing. The following table includes all possible items as a
reference.

##### Topic fields #####

The fields specific to the topic being edited are dynamic. How to assign new field and how to
unassign them are covered in detail in sections [Using the Type Configuration
Pages](#using-the-type-configuration-pages) and [Using Instance Editing
Pages](#using-instance-editing-pages).

##### Ontology typing topics access #####

Not shown in [Figure: Page layout](#page-layout), but available on all the Type Index Pages is a
secondary navigation bar to facilitate navigation from one Type Index Page to another (see [Figure:
Occurrence Type Index Page](#occurrence-type-index-page) for an example).

| Item | Description | 
|---|---|
| `Topic Types` | Access to the Topic Type Index. | 
| `Occurrence Types` | Access to the Occurrence Type Index | 
| `Association Types` | Access to the Association Type Index | 
| ` Role Types` | Access to the Role Type Index | 
| `Name Types` | Access to the Name Type Index | 

#### Icons ####

The icons described in the table below occur throughout all Ontopoly pages.

| Icon | Name | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| ![images/expand.gif](images/expand.gif)  | Expand | The boxed plus sign expands the under the current topic. | 
| ![images/collapse.gif](images/collapse.gif)  | Collapse | The boxed minus sign collapses the hierarchy under the current topic. | 
| ![images/boxed.gif](images/boxed.gif)  | Blank box | The empty box precedes a topic that does not have any children in the hierarchy, and so, cannot be expanded or collapsed. | 
| ![images/goto.gif](images/goto.gif)  | Goto | The right double arrow icon is always used to navigate to another page. If the icon is located next to a text field that contains a URI, the client browser will open the page pointed to by the address. In the fields editor on the Topic Type Configuration Page the icon is used to navigate to the topic type that declared the field. This means that the field is an inherited field. | 
| ![images/dnd.gif](images/dnd.gif)  | Reorder | Used to change the order of fields in the Topic Type Configuration Page, and to change the order of field values on the instance editing page. | 
| ![images/expand_all.gif](images/expand_all.gif)  | Show input field |  On an Instance Editing Page, the circled plus sign is used to show a new input field so that one can add a new field value.  | 
| ![images/remove.gif](images/remove.gif)  | Hide input field |  When used on the Instance Editing Page, the circled minus sign is used to hide the input field. When used on the Topic Type Configuration Page, it is used to remove a value from an existing field or the use of the field itself. | 
| ![images/remove-value.gif](images/remove-value.gif)  | Remove value |  When used on the Instance Editing Page, the small circled minus sign is used to remove values from fields. In the fields editor on the Topic Type Configuration Page the icon is used to unassign fields from the topic type.  | 
| ![images/create.gif](images/create.gif)  | Create | The circled asterisk is always used to create a new topic. Where it occurs will control what type of topic is created at that point. Where a choice of topic types is available, a pop-up menu will be presented. | 
| ![images/help.gif](images/help.gif)  | Contextual help | The question mark in a green circle provides access to this User Guide. | 

#### Keyboard navigation ####

Ontopoly has no special support for keyboard navigation. In other words, the keyboard navigation is
as provided by your browser. This means the following:

Opera
:    First tab key press puts the cursor into the first control on the page. Following tab presses go to
     following controls, including buttons. Drop-down lists can be navigated with the arrow keys, and
     pressing a letter will jump to the first item whose name begins with that
     letter.

Firefox
:    As for Opera, except that links are included in the tab cycle.

Internet Explorer
:    As for Firefox, except that URL bar is first in tab cycle.
